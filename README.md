# Password Generator
This Password Generator is an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. Criteria options include setting the length of the password between 8 and 128 characters. Employees can also select whether or not the password will include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
